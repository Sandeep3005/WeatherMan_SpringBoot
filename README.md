 **Here's a simplified 15-day schedule with clear tasks for each day to guide you through building a Java API:**

**Days 1-3: Laying the Groundwork**

- **Day 1:**
    - Pick a web framework: Spring Boot, JAX-RS, or Spark.
    - Create a basic project structure with folders for models, controllers, etc.
- **Day 2:**
    - Learn about RESTful API principles and CRUD operations.
    - Practice writing simple JSON data structures.
- **Day 3:**
    - Set up a database or data store (MongoDB, H2, etc.).
    - Experiment with basic data access operations (create, read).

**Days 4-7: Building Core API Features**

- **Day 4:**
    - Create a controller with a single endpoint returning a static JSON response.
    - Understand request mapping and routing.
- **Day 5:**
    - Define your data model class.
    - Implement basic persistence (CRUD) in your database.
- **Day 6:**
    - Connect your controller to the data access layer.
    - Retrieve and return serialized JSON data from the database.
- **Day 7:**
    - Create a form-based endpoint to receive, validate, and store data.
    - Test and debug your code thoroughly.

**Days 8-11: Enhancing Functionality**

- **Day 8:**
    - Explore data validation libraries like Bean Validation.
    - Implement comprehensive data checks in your API.
- **Day 9:**
    - Learn about error handling and exception management.
    - Implement standardized error responses.
- **Day 10:**
    - Write unit tests for API endpoints and data access methods.
    - Use testing frameworks like JUnit and Mockito.
- **Day 11:**
    - Implement user authentication and authorization (e.g., JWT tokens).

**Days 12-15: Refining and Launching**

- **Day 12:**
    - Review and refactor code for readability and maintainability.
    - Organize project structure efficiently.
- **Day 13:**
    - Write comprehensive API documentation.
    - Use tools like Swagger for interactive documentation.
- **Day 14:**
    - Choose a deployment platform (Heroku, AWS, etc.).
    - Package and configure your application for deployment.
- **Day 15:**
    - Deploy your API to the chosen platform.
    - Test functionality in production and monitor performance.
